# Gate Wraper

Wrapper for [Gate](https://gate.ac.uk) annotation natural language processing
utility.  This is a small wrapper that makes the following easier:
* Annotating Documents
* Create Store Documents
* Creating Annotation Schemas

This is handy if you automate annotation of documents and then want to bring
them into the GUI to do further annotation or just visually look at your
annotations.
